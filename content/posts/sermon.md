# Tempted, Tested, and Triumphant (Luke 4:1–13)
1st Sunday of Lent | David Flood

## Introduction
- Lent commemorates the 40 days that Jesus fasted and was tempted in the wilderness.
- Jesus’ temptation begins his active ministry, which ends with passion week. Lent, likewise, begins with self-examination, self-denial, and penitence and ends on Easter, proving the value of persevering.
-  In lent, we get to reenact this as a community and identify with Jesus more closely. Jesus emerged from his temptation triumphant. During lent we reflect on what holds us back from following him more closely, more radically.

## Scripture Interpretation
### 4:1–2 | Into the Wilderness
> 4:1 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2 where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.

#### Looking Back
Jesus is reliving previously stories in which God’s children failed to persevere when tested and tempted.
##### 40 Years in the Wilderness
- During the exodus, God’s children fail the test and an entire generation is sentenced to wander for 40 years.
- Jesus’ 40 days in the wilderness identifies with the people in their suffering, but _not_ only symbolically.
- Deuteronomy 8:2, “Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years, to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands.”
- Jesus is here to prove himself not only with his teaching, but also with his life.

##### Adam and Eve Tempted in the Garden
Jesus is the second Adam; will the second Adam succeed where the first failed?

#### Looking Forward
- The pain and suffering of Jesus’ coming death loom over his temptation.
- Jesus’ active ministry is bookended by this suffering and the suffering of passion week.

### 4:3–4 | Make some bread
> 4:3 The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.” 4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’”

#### Recapitulating the 40 Years
- Jesus understands why turning stones to bread is no trivial thing.
-  Jesus was not led into the wilderness to _feast_, he was led into the wilderness to be tested and to _prove_—even in his weakened state—that he will keep God’s commands and he will remain humble.
**Deuteronomy 8:2–3**
> 2 Remember how the LORD your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years, to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands. 3 He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna…to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. 

#### Recapitulating the First Temptation
- Notice how the devil began his temptation, “If you are the son of God….” It is a similar trick that was played on Eve, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?” (Gen. 3:1).
- “The trick, of course, that Eve did not recognize is to try and answer the devil on the devil’s own terms” (Stanley Hauerwas, _Matthew_, Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible)
 

Jesus, of course demonstrates how to respond to the devil’s tricks and manipulations. Jesus did not accept the terms of the debate. Jesus’ answer cut to the heart of what he was there to do and why. He did not need to entertain thoughts from another concerning when and how he exercised his divine rights. Jesus, not Satan, is in control of how responds to his deep hunger.

### 4:5–7 | Authority without the Cross
> 4:5 The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. 6 And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. 7 If you worship me, it will all be yours.” 8 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.’”

- Jesus has the right to be king of the earth, but the plan to save us requires that Jesus go through the cross. The devil is offering a shortcut.
- The glaring problem is that only one is to be worshiped, and the devil is not that one. Again, the problem isn’t the authority, that was another trick, another red herring. Jesus came to be humble and obedient to his father.
- Even though he has the right to power and authority, Jesus does not crave it. Can we, who live in the richest and most powerful country in the world, learn something from this attitude?

### 9–11 | Good people shouldn’t die
> 4:9 The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down from here. 10 For it is written: “ ‘He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully; 11 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’” 12 Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”

- Twice Jesus has answered with scripture, saying, “it is written.” Now, the devil does the same.
- This temptation is about death. The devil quotes from Psalm 91, which claims that God will protect the righteous person. So, Jesus should save himself, he does not deserve to suffer and die.

**Psalm 91**
> 1 Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. 2 I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.” 3 Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence. 4 He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. 5 You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, 6 nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. 7 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. 8 You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked. 9 If you say, “The Lord is my refuge,” and you make the Most High your dwelling, 10 no harm will overtake you, no disaster will come near your tent. _11_ For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; _12_ they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent. 14 “Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. 15 He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him. 16 With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.”

- How unfair is this? Adam and Eve earn death with their disobedience. Israel earns the death of a generation in the wilderness for her rejection of God’s plan. And yet, Jesus, by obeying his father, by doing what no one else could, for him, this leads to death. A death that will bring all of us eternal life in the New World. 
- And that dedication to the father and the plan to save his children, that leads to Jesus’ reply, “It is said, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
- Jesus again refuses to meet the devil on his own terms.

### 13 Until Next Time
> 13 When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.

The passage ends quite ominously. You could read this as, “the devil left…_until next time._” And indeed, Jesus will go on to be be tested and tempted for the next three years until his obedient death on the cross. “Well done good and faithful,” indeed.
