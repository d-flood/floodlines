## Happy Mother's Day, Mom!

On this Mother's Day, in May of 2025, I am glad I have the opportunity to celebrate my mom.

Mom, one of your greatest gifts to me is that you have *encouraged me*. You encourage me to do hard things, and you support me when things get hard. Things like...
- Going to college
- Getting married
- Becoming a father
- Going to grad school
- Getting a PhD
- Buying a house
- Selling a house!

In all these things and more, I believe that *you* believe in me, that you are proud of me. I know it is supposed to be cliche that the only person who reads someone's blog post or academic paper is their mother... but golly if it isn't true that you've been there to read and listen and encourage. That has meant a lot to me. Thank you, Mom.

But feeling proud goes both ways! I am proud of you. I'm taking notes on how you gracefully transitioned from being a parent of children, to being a parent of adults, and to becoming a grandparent, all without missing a beat. I'm infinitely grateful for your generosity, the time you give to me and my family. I can't believe how quickly you recovered from breaking your ankle (while spending time with grandkids!). You wanted to be able to play with your grandkids, you wouldn't stay down. Mom, you are an inspiration.

You are an **encourager**. Which is why I have written a song for you on this Mother's Day and named it, "The Encourager."

I love you, Mom.
