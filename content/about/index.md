## Quick Aside: Why am I even writing?

I'm positive I'm not the only one trying to think critically about the current moment. While my context is American Christianity, I know that similar discussions and movements are happening in South Korea, Hungary, and Russia. I can think all day (and I do), but I don't really understand something unless I've explored it in writing. That's what blog is for: _not_ "thinking out loud" as much as opening Schrödinger's box and to solidify opinions and convictions in my mind that otherwise exist in a quantum state of competing considerations and nuances. Or—to use another metaphor depicting animal mortality—by writing I discover the horse is long dead and can finally be laid to rest. Once it is written down, I'm free!

Additionally, a blog seems relaxing. For fifteen years I've been writing academic papers. The research, the citations, the synthesis of disparate sources, I love that! That's why I didn't completely pull my hair out getting a PhD. But, still, it is nice to reflect without stringent style guides and the expectation that my writing is a unique contribution to my academic field. I'd just like to share some things with people I actually know in real life; friends and family.
