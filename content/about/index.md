This is my informal blog. I have [other outlets](https://davidaflood.com) for professional and academic writing. But rather than "thinking out loud," this is a space for reflections on research or topics which which I have engaged critically.

Additionally, a blog seems relaxing. For fifteen years I've been writing academic papers. The research, the citations, the synthesis of disparate sources, I love that! That's why I didn't completely pull my hair out getting a PhD. But, still, it is nice to communicate without stringent style guides and the expectation that my writing is a unique contribution to my academic field. I'd just like to share some things with people I actually know in real life.
